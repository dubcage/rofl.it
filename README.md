Because `lmao.it.com` was $13,000 and `rofl.it.com` was only $7. 
Best investment ever.

## What is this?

Honestly? No clue yet. But it's gonna be hilarious.

## Maybe it'll be...

- A collection of the internet's funniest memes
- A joke API that returns random dad jokes
- A blog about laughing at my own life choices
- Just a placeholder until I think of something better
- All of the above
